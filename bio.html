		<p id="bio">
			My mother is from Taiwan, while my Father is from New Hampshire. They met in Lowell, Massachusetts, which is where I was born. Soon after, our family moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, where I was raised. I currently attend Tufts University where I'm studying Computer Science and Music Engineering. In my free time I enjoy playing violin and guitar, and going the beach.
